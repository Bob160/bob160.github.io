��Hey there!

Welcome to my webpage. As a junior developer, I realised it is important to host my website, containing a bit of my bio and all of my teething projects. I will be creating my blog where I'll document my experiences as a developer and other related issues. Please, feel free to tour this webpage. I hope you enjoy your time here and see something(s) interesting. If you need to contact me for anything, anything at all, just send me a mail: bobrox44@gmail.com
